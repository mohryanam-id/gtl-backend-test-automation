# Backend Test Automation Assignment

## Summary

- I create DummyAPI to help simulating the endpoint, It is using OpenAPI specs and Flask.
- I am using Pytest Framework for the testing, and Allure Framework for the reporting
- The flow to compare the file is like below:

```text
check unique keys -> check other values -> create the result to the report
```

## Description

This is a Python script for comparing two CSV files returned by the /getSecuritiesList API, where one file is generated by the latest master version of the application and the other file is generated by the last released version of the application. The purpose of this script is to perform regression testing for the functionality during every release.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install Allure Framework (<https://docs.qameta.io/allure/>)
- Run Terminal/Powershell
- Run Allure by executing

```bash
allure serve ./report/allure
```

- Install python (<https://realpython.com/courses/installing-python-windows-macos-linux/>)

- [Optional] Create virtual environment and Activate it (<https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>)

- Install the required packages by running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the script by executing

```bash
python3 dummyapi/app.py
```

or if it's error

```bash
python dummyapi/app.py
```

## Usage

Run the script.

```bash
pytest
```

## Output

The script will output a allure report showing the differences between the two CSV files on the test cases, if any. If there are no differences, the report will indicate that the two files are identical.

## Improvements

Some possible improvements to this script include:

- Adding more error handling to the script to handle potential errors.
- Adding logging functionality to the script to log errors and other events.
- Providing more options for configuring the script, such as setting the column names dynamically.
- Adding more tests to cover edge cases and potential errors.
- Refactoring the code.
- Use dockerization
- Use AI to check false-positive or false-negative
